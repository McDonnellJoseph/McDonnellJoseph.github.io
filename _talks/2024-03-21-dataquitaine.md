During the 2024 edition I had the great pleasure of presenting the **Etag** application built by [fieldbox](https://www.fieldbox.ai/) for [egis](https://www.egis-group.com/) accompanied by Axelle Sierra and Thomas Lesage. 
The **Etag** application is used for labelling requirements in large functionnal specification documents. The applications comes with an AI to suggest relevant requirements to the user. 

In this talk we present the two different approaches that have been implemented for this use-case. First using XGBoost to train a multi-category classifier over text embeddings of sentences. Then with the advent of LLMs, using foundational models for unsupervised classification of requirements.
