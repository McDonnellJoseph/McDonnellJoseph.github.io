# Sthack 2024 Reverse Engineering Lyoko

This is a write-up for a challenge rated as medium at the [2024 edition of sthack in Bordeaux](https://www.sthack.fr/). 

In the challenge's description it is mentionned someone has left a backdoor and we need to find it to strop xana. Let's start by running the code. 

```bash
$ ./lyoko
./lyoko: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./lyoko)
```
:open_mouth:

## Getting the binary to run

Running file on the binary we learn that it is a 64-bit ELF.

```bash
$ file lyoko
lyoko: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=e81881d8b4e31a69796800f0baad477b5cb30792, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

Obviously it was compiled with a different version of GLIBC that the one available on my computer and simply will not run. This is a problem I've encountered often with pwn and reverse engineering ctf challenges. 
I've written a small dockerfile to run the binary within a container. It's probably not the most efficient but it gets the job done. 

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y socat gdb vim python3 python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential # Install gef for a better gdb experience


WORKDIR /home/user
RUN python3 -m venv /home/user # Install pwntools on the container for scripting exploits
RUN bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools
COPY ./lyoko /home/user/


RUN chmod +x lyoko

CMD ["/bin/sh"]
```

Build and run the image: 

```bash
$ docker build -t lyoko .  
$ docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined lyoko
/# ./lyoko

And voila we are greated with a beautiful ascii art code lyoko logo. 

## 2. Reversing with ghidra 

Reversing the binary in ghidra we find the following main function:

```c
void MAIN(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  
  FUN_00101389();
  signal(0xe,RESTART_FUN);
  signal(8,PRINT_BCKDR);
  alarm(0x1e);
  FUN_0010172d();
  PUT_XANA();
  MAYBE_PUTS("XANA Management Console \n",0x1e);
  do {
    MAYBE_PUTS(&DAT_00102640,0x1e);
    iVar1 = getchar();
    CHOICE_FUN((int)(char)iVar1);
  } while( true );
}

```
First thing we notice is the two calls to signal. According to man signal: "signal() sets the disposition of the signal signum to handler, which is either SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL, or the address  of  a  programmer-defined  function  (a "signal handler").
". Therefore `signal` maps the code of C signal (segmentation fault for example) to a handler function. 

Here we have to signals that are handled:
- 14: Maps to `SIGALARM`, a signal called when a timer expires. 
- 8: Maps to `SIGFPE`, reports a fatal arithmetic error.

Next an alarm is set to ring every 30 seconds. 

Next the introduction text is printed a single char is retrieved from stdin and we enter a while true loop where the `CHOICE_FUN` is called with the user's input. Some interesting control logic is hidden in the signal handler functions but we'll get to that later. 

Let's continue exploring the natural flow of the code. `CHOICE_FUN` looks like this once disassemble:

```c
void CHOICE_FUN(char param_1)

{
  if (param_1 == 's') {
    MOBS_FUN();
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0x2a);
  }
  if (param_1 < 't') {
    if (param_1 == 'h') {
      HELP_FUN();
      return;
    }
    if (param_1 == 'q') {
      MAYBE_PUTS("Exiting session ....",0x3c);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      exit(0x539);
    }
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(0x539);
}
```

We notice that whatever we input we exit the program for example we can try running the program with `h` or `q` and we'll return to the terminal.

```
XANA Management Console 
> h
-- Help  --
Do you really need my help ? :)>
#
```

However if we select `s`:

```
XANA Management Console 
> s
Sending mobs...
How much mobs: 

> 
50
Total army strength : 20 
Reconfiguring mob army...
 Done ! Attack launched !> 
```

This is what the `MOBS_FUNC` looks like once decompiled:

```c
void MOBS_FUN(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_18;
  undefined4 local_14;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  MAYBE_PUTS("Sending mobs...\n",10);
  puts("How much mobs: \n");
  puts("> \n");
  __isoc99_scanf("%d",&local_18);
  local_14 = 1000;
  DAT_00104010 = 1000 / local_18;
  printf("Total army strength : %d \n",(ulong)DAT_00104010,1000 % (long)local_18 & 0xffffffff);
  MAYBE_PUTS("Reconfiguring mob army...\n ",0x3c);
  puts("Done ! Attack launched !");
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```
This function receives a user's input that is sanitised with `scanf` and the `%d` formatting. It then divides 1000 with the user's input and stores the result in a variable. 
Finally it prints the result of the previous computation. Here we notice we gain control over an arithmetic operation, in particular if we send 0 we can crash the program. Let's try this out. 

```bash
How much mobs: 

> 

0
Segmentation fault
```

As expected execution fails with a segfault. This would trigger the signal set on arithmetic operations error. Let's look into it and see what happens:

```c

void PRINT_BCKDR(int param_1)

{
  char *__s;
  size_t sVar1;
  int local_24;
  
  if (param_1 == 8) {
    __s = getenv("BCKDR");
    sVar1 = strlen(__s);
    for (local_24 = 0; (ulong)(long)local_24 < sVar1; local_24 = local_24 + 1) {
      printf("%d ",(ulong)(byte)(__s[local_24] ^ 0x7f));
    }
    putchar(10);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  return;
}
```
Interesting, we see that the handler function for the arithmetic error prints an obfuscated environment variable. When ran it stores in `__s` the content of the environment variable `BCKDR`. It then prints the result of xoring each element of `BCKDR` with 127.
Let's try this locally by setting the environment variable `BCKDR` before running lyoko.


```bash
\#BCKDR=toto ./lyoko

XANA Management Console 
> s
Sending mobs...
How much mobs: 

> 

0
11 16 11 16
```

Cooool so the printf works. When the challenge was up it returns the following:

`62 26 19 22 11 30`

Since XOR is bijective we can use python to figure out what value is BCKDR is set to in on challenge server.
```python
>>> "".join([chr(el ^ 127) for el in [62, 26, 19, 22, 11, 30]])
'Aelita'
```

Great so we know the `BCKDR` variable on the remote server is set to `Aelita`.

### 2.b Reversing the WIN function

Exploring the rest of the code we discover a mysterious function:

```c
void WIN_FUN(void)

{
  ulong __len;
  size_t sVar1;
  undefined *__src;
  code *pcVar2;
  undefined *puVar3;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined auStack_108 [8];
  ulong local_100;
  char *local_f8;
  ulong local_f0;
  undefined8 local_e8;
  undefined *local_e0;
  code *local_d8;
  code *local_d0;
  undefined8 local_c8;
  undefined8 local_c0;
  undefined8 local_b8;
  undefined8 local_b0;
  undefined8 local_a8;
  undefined8 local_a0;
  undefined8 local_98;
  undefined8 local_90;
  undefined8 local_88;
  undefined8 local_80;
  undefined8 local_78;
  undefined8 local_70;
  undefined8 local_68;
  undefined8 local_60;
  undefined8 local_58;
  undefined8 local_50;
  undefined local_48;
  long local_40;
  
  local_40 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_c8 = 0xe809a6fd21ac5409;
  local_c0 = 0x6963df4161741a59;
  local_b8 = 0x469e424604e6174;
  local_b0 = 0x650f54f9216c6541;
  local_a8 = 0x216c65416ecd696c;
  local_a0 = 0xb34521a4ec099e45;
  local_98 = 0x5534b14c7ae66373;
  local_90 = 0x9624a6be29b29624;
  local_88 = 0x29971c6c9cc229bd;
  local_80 = 0x54099e8b9693a286;
  local_78 = 0x46d32d179e45219a;
  local_70 = 0x361c1a434a2f0816;
  local_68 = 0x604ef82c52063a15;
  local_60 = 0x69696a41617455d4;
  local_58 = 0x3618520a5a3e5c31;
  local_50 = 0x651250135c1a0d77;
  local_48 = 10;
  local_f8 = getenv("BCKDR");
  local_f0 = 0x81;
  local_e8 = 0x80;
  for (puVar3 = auStack_108; puVar3 != auStack_108; puVar3 = puVar3 + -0x1000) {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -8) = *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -8);
  }
  *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -8) = *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -8);
  __len = local_f0;
  local_e0 = puVar3 + -0x90;
  for (local_100 = 0; local_100 < local_f0; local_100 = local_100 + 1) {
    puVar3[local_100 - 0x90] = *(byte *)((long)&local_c8 + local_100) ^ local_f8[local_100 % 6];
  }
  *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x10168f;
  pcVar2 = (code *)mmap((void *)0x0,__len,7,0x22,-1,0);
  __src = local_e0;
  sVar1 = local_f0;
  local_d8 = pcVar2;
  if (pcVar2 == (code *)0xffffffffffffffff) {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016af;
    perror("mmap");
  }
  else {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016d1;
    memcpy(pcVar2,__src,sVar1);
    pcVar2 = local_d8;
    local_d0 = local_d8;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016ed;
    (*pcVar2)();
    pcVar2 = local_d8;
    sVar1 = local_f0;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x101706;
    munmap(pcVar2,sVar1);
  }
  if (local_40 == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    return;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  __stack_chk_fail();
}
```

We notice the functions works through two main part with some obfuscation to frow us off.

The first interesting bit is here:

```c
local_f8 = get_env("BCKDR")
local_e0 = puVar3 + -0x90;
for (local_100 = 0; local_100 < local_f0; local_100 = local_100 + 1) {
  puVar3[local_100 - 0x90] = *(byte *)((long)&local_c8 + local_100) ^ local_f8[local_100 % 6];
}
```

This loop iterates through the data starting at local_c8 and stores it in puVar3. Interesting the data is XORed with `BCKDR`.

The second interesting part is here:

```c
  pcVar2 = (code *)mmap((void *)0x0,__len,7,0x22,-1,0);
  __src = local_e0;
  sVar1 = local_f0;
  local_d8 = pcVar2;
  if (pcVar2 == (code *)0xffffffffffffffff) {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016af;
    perror("mmap");
  }
  else {
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016d1;
    memcpy(pcVar2,__src,sVar1);
    pcVar2 = local_d8;
    local_d0 = local_d8;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x1016ed;
    (*pcVar2)();
    pcVar2 = local_d8;
    sVar1 = local_f0;
    *(undefined8 *)(puVar3 + -0x98) = 0x101706;
    munmap(pcVar2,sVar1);
  }
```
In the first line we create a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling proces starting at \0x0. 
The if/else loop is there to check if the `mmap` mapping succeeded. It it did succeed we copy the content of `puVar2` into the virtual mapping we have created. 
We then then execute code we have written starting at the adress of `pcVar2`.
Finally we revert the mapping using `munmap`.

We notice this function I called `WIN_FUNCTION` is called once in the code. 

```c
void __libc_csu_fini(void)

{
  if (DAT_00104010 < 1) {
    WIN_FUN();
  }
  return;
}
```

We enter the `__libc_csu_fini` whenever we exit the code. `DAT_00104010` is set in the function we enter when choosing the `s` action. So we need to make sure that 1000 divided by whatever we input is smaller than 1. We can either enter a negative number or a number greater than 1000.

Let's set a breakpoint at `__libc_csu_fini` and run the code. 

```bash
BCKDR=Aelite gdb ./lyoko
(gdb) b __libc_csu_fini

```
Although alsr is activated once we run the program with gdb the adresses won't change (given you are running the docker image with the correct arguments). Here we see our win function begins at: 
`0x5555555553ee`.

In ghidra we see the following line that is related to the disassemble `(*pcVar2)()`:

`001016eb ff d2           CALL       RDX`

Using offset we know the instruction is at adress `func_start + 0x2fd`. We could set a breakpoint and look at what the rdx register contains but first let's reverse the set of instructions we call with pcVar2 and see what it contains.

```python
# Hardcoded data in hexadecimal
encrypted_data = [
    0xe809a6fd21ac5409, 0x6963df4161741a59, 0x0469e424604e6174, 0x650f54f9216c6541,
    0x216c65416ecd696c, 0xb34521a4ec099e45, 0x5534b14c7ae66373, 0x9624a6be29b29624,
    0x29971c6c9cc229bd, 0x54099e8b9693a286, 0x46d32d179e45219a, 0x361c1a434a2f0816,
    0x604ef82c52063a15, 0x69696a41617455d4, 0x3618520a5a3e5c31, 0x651250135c1a0d77,
]

# Key "Aelita"
key = "Aelita"
key_len = len(key)

# Convert the encrypted data to bytes
encrypted_bytes = []
for value in encrypted_data:
    encrypted_bytes.extend(value.to_bytes(8, byteorder='little'))

# XOR decryption
decrypted_bytes = [
    encrypted_bytes[i] ^ ord(key[i % key_len]) for i in range(128)
]

# Convert decrypted bytes to string
decrypted_string = ''.join(chr(b) for b in decrypted_bytes)

print(decrypted_string)
# 5N¹H1ÿH	ÈH1Ò28Ðu0HÿÆHÿÃHÿÉHùuãHÇÇÿÿÿÿH1öH1ÿVH¿/bin//shWT_j;X¸<E=?f;lW6hv5g1S
```
Interestingly for us we notice `/bin//sh`, this must be the key to finishing the challenge. Some shellcode is hidden in the list of bytes and without the environment variable it is impossible to decode. If we jump back to gdb we can see what the instructions of this shellcode look like:

```bash

Great we are now at the beginning of the execution of the shell code. Let's print the instructions to try and make sense of it all:


```c
(gdb) x/50i 0x00007ffff7fbc000
=> 0x7ffff7fbc000:	xor    %rax,%rax
   0x7ffff7fbc003:	mov    %rax,%rdi

   0x7ffff7fbc01b:	lea    0x4e(%rip),%rsi        # 0x7ffff7fbc070
   0x7ffff7fbc022:	mov    $0xf,%ecx
   0x7ffff7fbc027:	xor    %rdi,%rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc02a:	mov    %rcx,%rax
   0x7ffff7fbc02d:	xor    %rdx,%rdx

   0x7ffff7fbc032:	mov    (%rbx),%dl
   0x7ffff7fbc034:	cmp    %dl,%al

   0x7ffff7fbc03b:	inc    %rbx
   0x7ffff7fbc03e:	dec    %rcx
   0x7ffff7fbc041:	cmp    $0x0,%rcx
   0x7ffff7fbc045:	jne    0x7ffff7fbc02a
   0x7ffff7fbc047:	mov    $0xffffffffffffffff,%rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc04e:	xor    %rsi,%rsi
   0x7ffff7fbc051:	xor    %rdi,%rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc054:	push   %rsi
   0x7ffff7fbc055:	movabs $0x68732f2f6e69622f,%rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc05f:	push   %rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc060:	push   %rsp
   0x7ffff7fbc061:	pop    %rdi
   0x7ffff7fbc062:	push   $0x3b
   0x7ffff7fbc064:	pop    %rax
   0x7ffff7fbc065:	cltd
   0x7ffff7fbc066:	syscall
   0x7ffff7fbc068:	mov    $0x3c,%eax
   0x7ffff7fbc06d:	syscall
   0x7ffff7fbc06f:	add    %al,0x3d(%rbp)
```

Using gdb we can set a breakpoint right after the first `syscall`(0x7ffff7fbc014), we notice the program stops and waits for a user input.

```
(gdb) x/s 0x7ffff7fbc080
0x7ffff7fbc080:	"toto\n"
```
Interesting enough we also notice what looks like a for loop starting at 034. We compare values between the `al` and `dl` register if they are not equal we jump to the end of the function and if they are we increment and bunch of registers and start over again. Let's break at the first xor operation.

```
(gdb) print $al
$9 = 15
(gdb) x/s 0x7ffff7fbc070
0x7ffff7fbc070:	"E=\177?f;lW6hv5g1S"
(gdb) 
```

With python we see that `chr(ord("E")^ 15)` returns J. So the correct input for the first step in our test is `J`. If we run the program again with an input starting with J we reach the second step of the iteration. Here we notice that the `al` registry was set to 14 before the XOR operation from there we can guess the `al` registry is incremented by -1 at each step and guess the value of the secret key.

```python
>>> al = 15
>>> for c in "E=\177?f;lW6hv5g1S":
...     print(chr(ord(c) ^ al))
...     al -= 1
J3r3m1e_1ns1d3R
```

Nice! This looks correct. If we enter this passphrase at the last text entry the last bit of shellcode that opens a shell is started and we're in.


## Lesson's Learnt

- A registry can have different mappings base on length for AL is an access to the bits in RAX.
- A simple Dockerfile to run challenges.
- GDB commands:
  + show env / set env for working with environment variables 
  + x/i for printing instructions
