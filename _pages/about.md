Passionate about data and computer science I enjoy applying these skills to solve complex problems. 

To learn more about me you can read my [CV](./cv/), or watch a talk I gave at [Dataquitaine](./talks/2024-03-21-dataquitaine).

In my spare time sometimes I like to write. You can head to my latest [blog posts](./year-archive/) and see if you can find something you like.
